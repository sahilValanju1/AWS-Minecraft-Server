# Custom Minecraft Server

> **Abstract** : This project describes the creation of a custom Minecraft server using Amazon Web Servicesâ€™ Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The server is built with Java and uses the official Minecraft server JRE files, game, and launcher. Our unique approach to hosting a Minecraft server on a cloud platform allows for improved scalability and reliability. By taking advantage of AWS EC2, we can provide a smooth gaming experience for players. This project demonstrates the potential of cloud computing to enhance the gaming experience.
